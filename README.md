# Archeopteryx
JS library to reliably track how user interacts with page content (link clicks, mouse overs, and other events).  Archeopteryx looks for HTML tags on a page that specify what HTML elements and JS events to listen for, and how to send data to site catalyst servers.  Allows event producers to add complex tracking to a page as a single tag, without custom coding or modifying the content-to-be-tracked directly.
